This is for the project of course Computational methods for Proteomics and Metagenomics (02725), where we are studying and comparing possible methods to accelerate the process of Mass Spectrum data (mzXML) clustering, which is a key step in interpreting the Mass Spectrum experiment. Here is the code needed to compare the effect of sparse index on improving the clustering efficiency.
